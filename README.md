# Forest-Cover-Type-Classification

Goal: Predict one of 7 forest cover types (a multi-class classification problem).

What We Did:

Dataset: Used the popular Kaggle Forest Cover Type Prediction dataset.

Data Prep: Engineered a new, strong feature: the Euclidean Distance to Hydrology, to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Comparison: Compared a simple Decision Tree (baseline) against a more powerful Random Forest model.

Optimization (Bonus): Used a hyperparameter tuning technique (RandomizedSearchCV) on the Random Forest to find its absolute best settings.

Result:

The final, tuned Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of ~96.5%+, successfully completing the task and demonstrating a high level of proficiency in model optimization.
